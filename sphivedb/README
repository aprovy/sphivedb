SPHiveDB is a server for sqlite database. It use jsonrpc over HTTP to expose
a network interface to use sqlite database. It supports to combine multiple
sqlite databases into one file. It also supports to use multiple files. It is
designed for the extreme sharding schema -- one sqlite database per user. 


Test example:

bash$ ./sphivedbsvr -p 8080 -f sphivedbsvr.ini
bash$ ./testcli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 8080 -i 0 -u foobar -n addrbook -s "insert into addrbook values ( 1, \"cde\" ); select * from addrbook;"


Any and all comments are appreciated.

Enjoy!
